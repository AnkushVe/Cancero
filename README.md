# Cancero

This project is a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload medical images or PDFs, and it provides detailed insights by utilizing AI-generated summaries and predictions. The application uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for image classification and a generative model for creating structured insights from both images and PDF files.

## Features

- **Image Upload and Prediction**: Upload medical images (e.g., X-rays, ultrasounds, CT scans) for classification.
- **PDF Upload and Summarization**: Upload PDF files to generate markdown-formatted summaries.
- **AI-Generated Insights**: Provides structured insights based on the model’s classification and PDF content using Google's Generative AI model.
- **Image Probability Plot**: Displays a plot showing the model’s confidence for each class prediction.
- **Confidence Score**: Displays the confidence score for the image prediction.
-   Education & Wellness Programs: Current features include a health dashboard, workshops, webinars, and cancer journey sharing etc.
-   Doctor Recommendations: The platform suggests specialized doctors based on location and cancer type, facilitating appointment bookings.
-   News & Visual Insights: Users access the latest cancer news and insightful statistics.
